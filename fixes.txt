    Needed changes:
        - Possibly make the cards for vibrant; make them look like they are valuable.
            * Possibly use this as a an outline? outline-solid bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 via-red-500 to-yellow-500 p-1
                ** Make it more vibrant/animate it

        - Make it more interactive. Maybe turn it into a game.
            * Possibly grab all possible stats from last season, and randomize a fantasy game from the player with those stats.
