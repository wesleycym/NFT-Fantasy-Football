    Bugs:
        1) NFT is double firing when purchasing. Says purchase successfull -> metamask fail -> metamask successfull. NFT still shows update [Rarely happens]
[FIXED - Images will have a gray box underneath (metamask issue)] Images for nfts are wack. They are not scaled properly.
[FIXED - Moved to description] Attributes not showing up.
        4) I don't have to connect my account when i purchase an NFT. It will just auto connect to my metamask and ask to confirm it. [Need to linearize the process]
[FIXED(Maybe?) - Manually delete NFTS] Hardhat accounts don't reset when I close and open it. The NFTs remain in the wallet.
        6) When changing the values of a player, change it so we can use their name instead of their designated number (order in which they were minted).
        7) I don't know if its minting 10 of each, but when I am not connected to the wallet, it still purchases yet it doesn't show up in my wallet, but i am the new owner.
        8) Owner changes, don't know if its a hardhat development issue
