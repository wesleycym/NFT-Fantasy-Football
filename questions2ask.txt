    Questions:
        - Is this structure correct?
        - I am using Pinata to host the NFTs, will I need to find a way to have the updated NFT reflect the purchased one in the wallet?
        - I assume we shouldn't be using static metadata. Should we be using a dynamic tokenURI() instead?
        - Is the metadata supposed to be onchain or offchain?
            - Images as of right now are offchain -> pinata.
        - Are external libraries allowed? Like one that will convert uint to string and another that will convert JSON to base64 (for meta data)

        - Compare my current hardhat config to the one given as an example: 
         module.exports = {
            defaultNetwork: "sepolia",
            networks: {
                hardhat: {
                },
                sepolia: {
                    url: "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<key>",
                    accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
                }
            },
            solidity: {
                version: "0.8.28",
                settings: {
                    optimizer: {
                        enabled: true,
                        runs: 200
                    }
                }
            },
            paths: {
                sources: "./contracts",
                tests: "./test",
                cache: "./cache",
                artifacts: "./artifacts"
            },
            mocha: {
                timeout: 40000
            }
        };
