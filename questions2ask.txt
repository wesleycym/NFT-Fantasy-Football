    Basic Info:
        - As of right now, I am minting 10 of each NFT, there are 8 total.
        - The NFTs a static upon purchase, but if updated the NFT will update and be available to purchase again.
            - Josh Allen starts with 0 FP, I purchase it. Josh Allen then gets 50 FP, I buy it again. I will then have
                2 Josh Allen NFTs, one with 0 FP and another with 50 FP.

    Questions:
        - Is this structure correct?
        - I am using Pinata to host the NFTs, will I need to find a way to have the updated NFT reflect the purchased one in the wallet?
        - I assume we shouldn't be using static metadata. Should we be using a dynamic tokenURI() instead?
        - Is the metadata supposed to be onchain or offchain?
            - Images as of right now are offchain -> pinata.
