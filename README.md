# üèà NFT Fantasy Football   

**NFT Fantasy Football** is an online NFT marketplace that allows users to mint a selected number of NFL players as unique NFTs. Each minted NFT is assigned a calculated fantasy score based on randomly selected real stats from the 2024‚Äì2025 NFL season.

On the offensive side of the ball, there are **11 categories** that factor into each player's score. Each category has **17 weekly entires**, all mapping to their respective statline for that week.   

> NFT Fantasy football is based off the **NFL Season** (weeks 1-18), not the **Fantasy Football Season** (weeks 1-17).   

Freshly minted NFTs pull a random week, from each of the 11 categories. Leading to ~ **34 trillion unique, weekly combinations per player**.   

NFT fantasy football bases its scoring off the standard PPR format. When points are calculated, each player is given a corresponding rank based on the resembled performance.

This application uses a **hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture**. All core NFT attributes (fantasy score, player info, rank) are stored fully **on-chain**, while dynamic stat generation and image hosting are handled **off-chain**. This design keeps the smart contract cost-efficient while preserving essential metadaya for every uniquely minted NFT.
