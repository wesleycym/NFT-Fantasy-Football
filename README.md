Even though the contract owner's address is public (as it must be for proper UI logic), all critical functions are protected on-chain with msg.sender checks. This ensures only the true owner (with the private key) can execute them, regardless of any frontend manipulation.   

“Each NFT is uniquely generated from real NFL stat data, using 11 performance categories and 17 weeks of potential values — resulting in over 3.4 quintillion unique combinations per player.”
